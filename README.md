# 🖼️ CaptionGen: Caption Generation Using PyTorch

Welcome to **CaptionGen**! In this project, we’ll develop a caption generator for images using two powerful architectures—ConvNeXt and Transformers. Leveraging PyTorch as the deep learning framework, we’ll train and fine-tune these models to automatically generate captions for images. Let’s dive into the exciting world of generative AI! 🤖📝

## 🌐 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can automatically generate captions for images, bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. We’ll use ConvNeXt for image feature extraction and Transformer models for caption generation. The Flickr8k dataset will be fine-tuned with pretrained models, and the project will culminate with an interface to use the model for generating captions on new images.
